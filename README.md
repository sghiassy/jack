# JACK - Just a Counter, K?

## What is JACK?
JACK stands for **Just a Counter, K?**

This project is exactly what it claims to be—just a counter. It does nothing more than increment and decrement a value. That’s it.

## Why Does JACK Exist?

Why build something so simple? Because **JACK isn’t about the product; it’s about the process.**

JACK serves as a case study in modern software complexity. By stripping the product down to its barest form, we can highlight the sheer magnitude of requirements that exist beyond core functionality.

## The Hidden Complexity of Software Engineering

Even for a trivial application like JACK, the surrounding software infrastructure can be staggering:

- **Multiple frontends:** iOS, Android, Web, Desktop, etc.
- **Backend technologies:** Databases, caching, sharding, APIs.
- **DevOps & Deployment:** Containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines.
- **Security & Authentication:** OAuth, SSO, encryption.
- **Project Management:** Agile workflows, documentation, issue tracking.
- **Open Source Management:** Licensing, dependencies, contributions.
- **Software Migrations:** Versioning, backward compatibility, data migration.

By keeping the **product functionality at zero**, JACK exposes the often invisible layers of software engineering that make even the simplest applications deceptively complex.

## What’s Next?
JACK is an evolving exploration of software complexity. If you’d like to contribute, discuss, or challenge the premise, feel free to get involved!
